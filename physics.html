		<p> <strong> Physics </strong> is the natural science of matter, involving the study of matter,

		its fundamental constituents,  its motion and behavior through space and time,
		and the related entities<br> of energy and force. 
		Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines,
		with its main goal being to understand how the universe behaves.,
		A scientist who specializes in the field<br> of physics is called a <em> physicist </em>.<br><br>
		Physics is one of the oldest academic disciplines and, through its inclusion of astronomy,
		perhaps the oldest.[6] Over much of the past two millennia, physics, chemistry, biology, 
		and certain <br> branches of mathematics were a part of natural philosophy,
		but during the Scientific Revolution in the 17th century these natural sciences emerged as unique research endeavors in their own right.<br>
		Physics intersects with many interdisciplinary areas of research, such as biophysics and quantum chemistry, 
		and the boundaries of physics are not rigidly defined.<br>
		New ideas in physics often explain the fundamental mechanisms studied by other sciences[3]
		and suggest new avenues of research in these and other academic disciplines such as mathematics and philosophy.

		<h2> History </h2>
		<h4> <i> Main article: <b>History of physics </b> </i></h4>

		<p> The word physics comes from the Latin physica ('study of nature'),
		which itself is a borrowing of the Greek φυσική (phusikḗ 'natural science'),<br>
		a term derived from φύσις (phúsis 'origin, nature, property').
		</p><h5>Ancient astronomy</h5>
		Astronomy is one of the oldest natural sciences. Early civilizations dating before 3000 BCE,
		such as the Sumerians, ancient Egyptians, and the Indus Valley Civilisation, 
		had a predictive knowledge <br> and a basic awareness of the motions of the Sun, Moon, and stars. 
		The stars and planets, believed to represent gods, were often worshipped. <br>
		While the explanations for the observed positions of the stars were often unscientific and lacking in evidence,
		these early observations laid the foundation for later astronomy, as the stars were found to traverse great circles across the sky,
		[6] which could not explain the positions of the planets.
